<br />
I was part of a Hacking for Defense class, which is both a class and an internship. In
this class, I was part of a group of five other students who worked to solve a real-world problem.
Our problem was to solve the issue of active shooters on base (specifically the Pearl Harbor
military base). This issue was brought up recently because of an active shooter incident on
Pearl Harbor on December 4th, 2019 where an active shooter shot and killed two civilian
workers before commiting suicide.
<br />
<br />
We interviewed over 40 interviewees, most of whom were workers on base who were
there when the December 4th incident happened and shared their stories with us and did a tour
on base to see how the layout looked like. Our interviewees told us that some of the biggest
problems in the system that prevented people from being better prepared for active shooter
incidents were the communications systems (the on-base speaker, the Giant Voice, for
instance) and lack of adequate training due to the training not being engaging enough.
<br />
<br />
With that in mind, we came up with some possible solutions and presented them in front
of our base sponsor, professor, and other professionals which included more engaging training
modules (first picture) and information posters. We did not focus too much on communication
issues for our end product due to the fact that the base claims they are already working on
improving such issues.
