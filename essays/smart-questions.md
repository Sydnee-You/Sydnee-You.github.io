  <h2> "There is no such thing as a stupid question" They Said...</h2>
<p>
Growing up, I've often heard people, especially teachers, encourage others to ask questions if they are confused.  I've heard the notion that "there is no such thing as a dumb question" tossed around quite often.  However, is that *really* true or are people who use that phrase (especially teachers) merely sugarcoating reality?  If StackOverflow has taught me anything, it is definitely the latter. </p>

   Many newer users tend to make the mistake of asking too general of a question ("How do I do <insert task that may take hundreds of lines of code>"), not explaining the question in enough detail (the user does not explain what he or she attempted to solve the problem before asking the question or what erros showed up in the code), asking the web to solve an entire homework problem, and generally asking something that may have already been asked because she or he did not spend the time searching the question online or reading a textbook first.  This all leads to quite a few disgruntled veterans who will tell them off for asking a bad question.  While these people may come across as rude at first, they may have a good point.  All these common mistakes are often the result of the user being too lazy to do their own research or solve things on their own first.  Letting these questions slide could encourage laziness and encourage users to feel as if they are entitled to having any and all of their questions answered.  The truth is, many more experienced users often have busy and demanding schedules, and they take time out of their day to answer questions without expecting anything in return.  It is simple courtesy to ask a precise question with a sufficient amount of detail.

  <h2>User used Bad Question!  It's not Very Effective...</h2>


<a href='https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/400643/what-should-i-do-if-i-am-post-banned-but-i-can-not-modify-any-of-my-bad-question'>Not-so-good-question</a> asked by Hydro on StackOverflow
  <p>As with many not-so-great questions, the original question had already been deleted, so this response resposting Hydro's question is the closest I could find to the orignal question.  Unfortunately, the repost did not include the code Hydro used.</p>
<br>
  <b>Hydro's Question:</b>
  <br>
<p>So. I am trying to move my character. I wrote it just like in a tutorial. It didn't work so I tried to fix it but just 
ruined other things. Can someone please tell me what the problem is? It would be also nice if someone would tell me how 
to resize the objects, buttons, etc when I maximize my Pygame Window? I don't know what the errors mean. Can someone 
please try this code on their own and then tell me what they mean and what to do? Here is the code:</p> 
<br>
<p>This question is not among the bottom-of-the-barrel worst questions ever asked, but there are definitely some things that can be improved in regards to this question. As the responder pointed out, Hydro simply did not provide enough information regarding the question.  Hydro didn't specify which tutorial they were referring to, what they have tried so far to fix the issue, and what specifically did not work.  Hydro also claims they do not understand the erros but does not specify what erros are there.  People are less willing to answer such a question with so little detail such as this. </p>

  <h2>This StackOverflow Question is <i>Overflowing</i> with Great Information and A Great Question</h2>

 
<a href='https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-processing-an-unsorted-array'>Great question</a> asked by GManNickG on StackOverflow

  <p>As one can immediately tell by the overwhemingly high number of upvotes, this question received plenty of deserved attention, and rightfully so.  The original question was, "Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?"  The user displayed their code (that had comments to make the code even easier to read) and explained how fast it ran depending on whether or not certain things were included in the code or whether or not the code was sorted.  The user then explained they tried it with Java and once again showcased a sufficient amount of code related to the problem.  Then the user explained their thought process regarding the problem as well as additional follow-up questions they had.  This was a great question because of the sufficient amount of detail the user provided in regards to the question: they had a professional and specific title that immediately addressed their main question, they showed their code, explained what the code did, and asked follow-up questions they had in regards to the original question.  </p>

  <h2> Conclusion</h2>
  
  <p> While it may seem more welcoming to tell others, "there is no such thing as a bad question", the reality is that sometimes certain questions we ask really are not so great after all.  When we ask questions online, it is important to not only ask a specific question but to be considerate of others' schedules.  Show that you've done your research and your trial and errors.  Give others the details even if it may be a pain to write out.  While it may be tempting to ask a lazy question, at the end of the day, lazy bad questions help no one and only serve to waste others' time.  While smart questions may take much more time to come up with and to ask, they are worth asking and will earn you the respect of your fellow coders and benefit the community you are a part of.</p>
