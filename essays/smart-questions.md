  <h2> "There is no such thing as a stupid question" They Said...</h2>
<p>
Growing up, I've often heard people, especially teachers, encourage others to ask questions if they are confused.  I've heard the notion that "there is no such thing as a dumb question" tossed around quite often.  However, is that *really* true or are people who use that phrase (especially teachers) merely sugarcoating reality?  If StackOverflow has taught me anything, it is definitely the latter. </p>
<br>
  <p> Many newer users tend to make the mistake of asking too general of a question ("How do I do <insert task that may take hundreds of lines of code>"), not explaining the question in enough detail (the user does not explain what he or she attempted to solve the problem before asking the question or what erros showed up in the code), asking the web to solve an entire homework problem, and generally asking something that may have already been asked because she or he did not spend the time searching the question online or reading a textbook first.  This all leads to quite a few disgruntled veterans who will tell them off for asking a bad question.  While these people may come across as rude at first, they may have a good point.  All these common mistakes are often the result of the user being too lazy to do their own research or solve things on their own first.  Letting these questions slide could encourage laziness and encourage users to feel as if they are entitled to having any and all of their questions answered.  The truth is, many more experienced users often have busy and demanding schedules, and they take time out of their day to answer questions without expecting anything in return.  It is simple courtesy to ask a precise question with a sufficient amount of detail.

  <h2>User used Bad Question!  It's not Very Effective...</h2>


<a href='https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/400643/what-should-i-do-if-i-am-post-banned-but-i-can-not-modify-any-of-my-bad-question'>Not-so-good-question</a> asked by Hydro on StackOverflow
  <p>As with many not-so-great questions, the original question had already been deleted, so this response resposting Hydro's question is the closest I could find to the orignal question.  Unfortunately, the repost did not include the code Hydro used.</p>

  <b>Hydro's Question:</b>
  <br>
<p>So. I am trying to move my character. I wrote it just like in a tutorial. It didn't work so I tried to fix it but just 
ruined other things. Can someone please tell me what the problem is? It would be also nice if someone would tell me how 
to resize the objects, buttons, etc when I maximize my Pygame Window? I don't know what the errors mean. Can someone 
please try this code on their own and then tell me what they mean and what to do? Here is the code:</p> 
<br>
<p>This question is not among the bottom-of-the-barrel worst questions ever asked, but there are definitely some things that can be improved in regards to this question. As the responder pointed out, Hydro simply did not provide enough information regarding the question.  Hydro didn't specify which tutorial they were referring to, what they have tried so far to fix the issue, and what specifically did not work.  Hydro also claims they do not understand the erros but does not specify what erros are there.  People are less willing to answer such a question with so little detail such as this. </p>

  <h2>This StackOverflow Question is <i>Overflowing</i> with Great Information and A Great Question</h2>

 
<a href='https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-processing-an-unsorted-array'>Great question</a> asked by GManNickG on StackOverflow

  <p>What makes this question so good?</p>


 


  <h2> Conclusion</h2>

When we rely on others’ generosity and expertise to provide answers to our questions, it should hold that the question we ask should be one that leads to efficient and effective help that not only benefits us, but also the people we ask and others who might ask the same question in the future. Thus, if you have a question… make it a smart one! Asking questions may not always get you the best answer, but asking them in a way that will make others want to answer them will increase the success of finding a good solution and make it a positive experience on all sides.
