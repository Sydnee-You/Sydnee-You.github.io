  <h2> "There is no such thing as a stupid question" They Said...</h2>
<p>
Growing up, I've often heard people, especially teachers, encourage others to ask questions if they are confused.  I've heard the notion that "there is no such thing as a dumb question" tossed around quite often.  However, is that *really* true or are people who use that phrase (especially teachers) merely sugarcoating reality?  If StackOverflow has taught me anything, it is definitely the latter.

  <b>Hydro's Question:</b>
So. I am trying to move my character. I wrote it just like in a tutorial. It didn't work so I tried to fix it but just

to resize the objects, buttons, etc when I maximize my Pygame Window? I don't know what the errors mean. Can someone 
please try this code on their own and then tell me what they mean and what to do? Here is the code:

  <h2> Conclusion</h2>

When we rely on others’ generosity and expertise to provide answers to our questions, it should hold that the question we ask should be one that leads to efficient and effective help that not only benefits us, but also the people we ask and others who might ask the same question in the future. Thus, if you have a question… make it a smart one! Asking questions may not always get you the best answer, but asking them in a way that will make others want to answer them will increase the success of finding a good solution and make it a positive experience on all sides.
